# Project: Library from the Odin Project

- It should be a clean and simple design
- There should be an add Book button
- When you click add Book button a new small window should pop up with title, author, pages and if you have read it or not.
- The books should be contained in the middle of the page in a div where you can scroll through the books. Hence the books should not overflow the page
- This div should behave as if you look into a window and sees the books similar to box-shadow: inset
- Bottom should include link to my github
- There should be an book icon on the tab

Future extensions
- Add to container with books I have read and with books I want to read
- Each container should behave like initial one
- Add a recension button for each book
- Have a log in button where you can create an own account/library where you have all your books saved. This will probably make use of some kind of database (bear in mind while Im writing this I have yet no experience working with database's)
- The right part of the header should be an image of a bookworm. How does it work with copyright in this case? Can I create my own images (svg, paint-programs etc)? Where does the line go If my image is to similar to somebody else's?
- Make it work for smartphone
- Include a search engine that searches for books or for example recept. For example if you write bacon all the recept with bacon included will pop up. If you write james bond, james bond books till apppear.
- You should be able to upload a picture of the book cover.
